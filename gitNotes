git learning points (Basic cover )

1. in order to start git first open git bash 
go to that directory
type 'git init' // this initializes the git program

write any program with their respective extension

2. git add <file_name>  //this adds the respective file into staging stage
example git add Add.java // hit enter and it goes to staging stage

3. git commit -m "message" // this finally commits the file into master repository
4. to make any changes  we can simply open that file make changes and save using ctrl+save
then if we type git status // it will show that changes have made showing message file mdified

5. to remove the file or delete the file from staging stage 
'git rm --cached file_name' // this removes file from stagging.

6. To make branch from master  we have command 
'git branch dev' // A new branch will be made from master which is the main 

7. to switch from master to branch or vice versa we have command
'git checkout branchName'
example: 'git checkout dev'  // to switch from master to branch "dev";
example: 'git checkout master' // to switch from dev to master;
 all the content of the master is copied in the branch and whatever changes we make in branch does not reflect in master unless we merge it. when we merge the branch to master then all the changes reflects in master 
 
 8. to merge the branch
 'git merge branch name '
 example 'git merge dev' // this merges dev to master
 
 9.'git remote add origin https://github.com/6712amit/dsa_coding' // to connect local git to github sever.
 
 10. git remote -v // to see how many remote we have basicaly we have two fetch or pull and merge or push
 
 11.git command to push local files to github
 'git push -u origin master' // then all the commited file in local server is send to github server. in master branch if we have to send in dev branch (another branch) then go to that branch by git checkout dev then 
 enter command 'git push -u origin dev' // this pushed in dev branch. similarly we can do for other branch also
 
 12.we can also do staging and commit with one command 
 'git commit -am "message" ' 
 
 13. we can put multiple file in staging by 
 'git add .'
 
 14. if we are in some branch lets say master or dev then simply 
 'git push' // pushes the stage file int that perticular branch
 
 15. if we have made any changes in github then we can simply get those file in local by 
  'git pull'  // all the changes also reflectes in local files too;
