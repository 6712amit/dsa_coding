git learning points 

1. in order to start git first open git bash 
go to that directory
type 'git init' // this initializes the git program

write any program with their respective extension

2. git add <file_name>  //this adds the respective file into staging stage
example git add Add.java // hit enter and it goes to staging stage

3. git commit -m "message" // this finally commits the file into master repository
4. to make any changes  we can simply open that file make changes and save using ctrl+save
then if we type git status // it will show that changes have made showing message file mdified

5. to remove the file or delete the file from staging stage 
'git rm --cached file_name' // this removes file from stagging.

6. To make branch from master  we have command 
'git branch dev' // A new branch will be made from master which is the main 
7. to switch from master to branch or vice versa we have command
'git checkout branchName'
example: 'git checkout dev'  // to switch from master to branch "dev";
example: 'git checkout master' // to switch from dev to master;
 all the content of the master is copied in the branch and whatever changes we make in branch does not reflect in master unless we merge it. when we merge the branch to master then all the changes reflects in master 
 
 8. to merge the branch
 'git merge branch name '
 example 'git merge dev' // this merges dev to master
